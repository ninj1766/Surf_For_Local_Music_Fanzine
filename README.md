# Surf_For_Local_Music_Fanzine
Founded in 2007 this fanzine has focused on promoting live music in the New England area of USA. I'd like to expand upon it.
since then it transformed and grew. By 2021 the site was inundated with fake accounts of foreigners trying to take advantage of our music fan members. Then the site was attacked and was shut down.
Now in 2023. https://SurfForLocalMusic.com has been published again. this time instead of just focusing on the New England area, I'd like to make it Nationwide. Create a platform for independent creative consultant journalists that focus on positive reviews and to also create other opportunities that benefit local musicians and bands.
